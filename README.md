# Rich Text Editor with React and ReactQuill
This project is a rich text editor built using React and ReactQuill, designed as part of an assessment for Wazobia Technologies.

I started building the RichTextEditor from scratch but realised that may not have been the expected approach, but you can find the code for that in `components/RichTextEditor.jsx`

## Features
- Text Formatting: Bold, italic, alignment (left, center, right), lists (bullet, ordered), headings (H1 to H6).
- Embeds: Insert links and photos with interactive menus. 
- Modal: Included modal for additional content or features.

## Technologies Used
* React
* ReactQuill
* Tailwind CSS (for styling)
